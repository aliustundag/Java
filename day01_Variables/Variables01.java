        //In "public int age = 12;",  "public int age" is called "Variable Declaration".

        //While you type code on Eclipse, if you get yellow underline, it is not big issue.
        //Most probably you created a variable, but you did not use it yet.

        //If you create declare a variable without assigning any value in "main method",
        //when you try to use it will give you "red underline"
        //So do not try to use a variable inside the main method without assigning any value



        int age = 12;
        System.out.println(age);

        int height = 5;
        System.out.println(height);

        //Declare a char variable
        char initial;

        //Assign 'S' to "initial" variable
        initial = 'H';

        System.out.println(initial);
